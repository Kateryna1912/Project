# Project

I have a project idea with which you can buy and grow flowers.
The idea of the project is that if a person wants to buy and grow some plants, but this project will help him do it. 
It will work like this: 
1. A person registers to create their profile or not. 
2. Put the interesting name of the plant in the search engine. 
3. There is a choice of different types of vegetation that was set in the search engine. 
4. Click on some kind of plant.
5. Information about this plant appears (how much it costs, etc.).
5.1. It will also be possible to additionally click on,, button,, so that instructions for the care of this plant and tips for growing appear.
5.2. Also, by clicking on another,,button,, you can find out what you need to buy in addition to the plant (for example: what kind of pot, earth, etc.)
